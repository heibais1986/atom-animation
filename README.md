## 🔬 Scientific accuracy

This application uses the classic Bohr model to represent atomic structure, showing electrons in clear, planet-like orbits. However, modern quantum theory describes electrons existing in "electron clouds" or orbitals, which are regions of probability. Furthermore, the scale shown here is not realistic; the nucleus is actually minuscule compared to the vast space the electrons occupy.

## 🧪 Data Sources

All chemical data for the elements has been sourced from the world's leading scientific databases to ensure accuracy. Key sources include **PubChem**, the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)**, and recommendations from the **International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)**.
