# Contributing guide

Hi there! 👋 First of all — thank you for considering contributing to this project. Every bit of help is appreciated and valued.

This guide is here to explain how contributions work and to make sure we're all on the same page when it comes to collaboration and licensing.

## How to contribute

Whether you're fixing a typo, improving documentation, or adding a feature — you're welcome here. To contribute, simply:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Open a pull request

## Licensing of contributions

All contributions require a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This solution helps to maintain the project over the long term and avoids complicated relicensing efforts down the road. By submitting a pull request, you confirm that you agree to the terms of the CLA for the benefit of the project's future development.

## Other ways to support the project

Even if you're not contributing code, there are still valuable ways to get involved:

- **Open an issue** with feedback, suggestions, or bug reports — your input helps improve the project for everyone.
- **Support the project** through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/matt765) to help keep development active.

Every form of support means a lot and helps keep this project alive and growing.

## A Note of Thanks

Thanks again for taking the time to contribute.
